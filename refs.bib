  year =          {2005},
  abstract =      {This paper describes Automatic Pool Allocation, a
                   transformation framework that segregates distinct
                   instances of heap-based data structures into seperate
                   memory pools and allows heuristics to be used to
                   partially control the internal layout of those data
                   structures. The primary goal of this work is
                   performance improvement, not automatic memory
                   management, and the paper makes several new
                   contributions. The key contribution is a new compiler
                   algorithm for partitioning heap objects in imperative
                   programs based on a context-sensitive pointer
                   analysis, including a novel strategy for correct
                   handling of indirect (and potentially unsafe)
                   function calls. The transformation does not require
                   type safe programs and works for the full generality
                   of C and C++. Second, the paper describes several
                   optimizations that exploit data structure
                   partitioning to further improve program performance.
                   Third, the paper evaluates how memory hierarchy
                   behavior and overall program performance are impacted
                   by the new transformations. Using a number of
                   benchmarks and a few applications, we find that
                   compilation times are extremely low, and overall
                   running times for heap intensive programs speed up by
                   10-25\% in many cases, about 2x in two cases, and
                   more than 10x in two small benchmarks. Overall, we
                   believe this work provides a new framework for
                   optimizing pointer intensive programs by segregating
                   and controlling the layout of heap-based data
                   structures.},

  abstract =      {Processor and memory technology trends show a
                   continual increase in the cost of accessing main
                   memory. Machine designers have tried to mitigate the
                   effect of this trend through a variety of techniques
                   that attempt to reduce or tolerate memory latency.
                   These techniques, unfortunately, have only been
                   partially successful for pointer- manipulating
                   programs. Recent research has demonstrated that these
                   programs can benefit greatly from the complementary
                   approach of reorganizing pointer data structures to
                   improve cache locality. This paper describes how a
                   generational garbage collector can be used to achieve
                   a cache-conscious data layout, in which objects with
                   high temporal affinity are placed next to each other,
                   so they are likely to reside in the same cache block.
                   The paper demonstrates the feasibility of collecting
                   low overhead, real-time profiling information about
                   data access patterns for object-oriented languages,
                   and describes a new copying algorithm that utilizes
                   this information to produce a cache-conscious object
                   layout. Preliminary results indicate that this
                   technique reduces cache miss rates by
                   21-42$\backslash$\%, and improves program performance
                   by 14-37$\backslash$\%.},

Within a PAS the persistence concept is used to abstract over the physical properties of data such as where it is kept, how long it is kept and in what form it is kept. As such it is seen as having a number of benefits in simplifying the task of PAS programming. Here, we describe the integrated design of the Napier88 persistent programming system and how Napier88 may be used to develop PASs.",

abstract = {We present a new approach to programming languages for parallel computers that uses an effect system to discover expression scheduling constraints. This effect system is part of a 'kinded' type system with three base kinds: types, which describe the value that an expression may return; effects, which describe the side-effects that an expression may have; and regions, which describe the area of the store in which side-effects may occur. Types, effects and regions are collectively called descriptions.Expressions can be abstracted over any kind of description variable -- this permits type, effect and region polymorphism. Unobservable side-effects can be masked by the effect system; an effect soundness property guarantees that the effects computed statically by the effect system are a conservative approximation of the actual side-effects that a given expression may have.The effect system we describe performs certain kinds of side-effect analysis that were not previously feasible. Experimental data from the programming language FX indicate that an effect system can be used effectively to compile programs for parallel computers.},
